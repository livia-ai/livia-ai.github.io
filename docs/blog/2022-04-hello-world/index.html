<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>Welcome to the blog for the project Linking Viennese Art through Artificial Intelligence (or, as we like to call it - LiviaAI), a one-year long investigation, funded by the <a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/foerderungen/jubilaeumsfonds" rel="nofollow">Jubiläumsfond of the City of Vienna/Austrian Academy of Sciences</a>, based at the <a href="https://www.donau-uni.ac.at/de.html" rel="nofollow">Universität für Weiterbildung, Krems</a> and in partnership with the <a href="https://www.ait.ac.at" rel="nofollow">Austrian Institute of Technology</a>, the <a href="https://www.belvedere.at" rel="nofollow">Belvedere Museum Wien</a>, the <a href="https://www.mak.at" rel="nofollow">Museum für Angewandte Kunst</a> and the <a href="https://www.wienmuseum.at" rel="nofollow">Wien Museum</a>. </p>
<p>Over the next months, we will recording our progress here, keeping you up to date on where we are in the project and what we find, what we don’t find and what surprises might be in store. But first, a bit of background…</p>
<h2>The What</h2>
<p>LiviaAI will investigate the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to find patterns, connections and associations between digitised objects in Viennese art collections. There are three main goals to the project:
to explore the use of AI as a tool for Digital Humanists and museum curators to study the use of classification systems and vocabularies across museum collections;
to establish connections between online collections of our three museum partners, so that the associations between them and their individual objects become more visible; to demonstrate how AI can support new online exhibition formats that emphasise serendipitous browsing, exploration of contextual connections, and playful engagement with Vienna’s collected heritage.
Sounds simple, right? Well, sort of….</p>
<h2>The Why</h2>
<p>Vienna is home to world famous art collections, but at the moment, it is not possible for researchers, visitors to Vienna or interested users to search across these collections. We want to help build that capacity. To do so, we’re partnering with three very different, but equally well-known Viennese museums:
The Belvedere, which is renowned for its small but spectacular collection of art works by Viennese artists; the Wien Museum, with a large, heterogeneous collection documenting Vienna’s cultural history, and the Museum für Angewandte Kunst (MAK), which holds a large collection documenting Austria’s artistic and design history of the 19th and 20th century. The collections data from these museums has already been digitised and much of it can be searched online, but at the moment it is not possible to search across them, even though all three contain materials from similar periods of Vienna’s history, and have considerable overlap of artists (e.g. Klimt, Schiele), art groups, and design ideas. By building on cutting-edge deep learning techniques and natural language processing methods – most notably representation learning, triplet loss networks and word embeddings (more on those later) LiviaAI will enable museum professionals to design their own AI processes without needing to do the complicated, sometimes expensive manual data annotation work which is normally required to train AI models. This way, we can build expertise and lay the groundwork for embedding AI-supported methods and tools more deeply in future digital humanities curricula and, ultimately, everyday professional scholarly and curatorial practice. </p>
<h2>The How</h2>
<p>LiviaAI makes use of some of the most recent approaches in natural language processing and machine learning research. Our goal is to teach AI to measure similarity between images based on the visual content. In order to do this, we first need to find examples of images that are “similar” (according to some criterion), and those that are different, so that the AI can learn from them - and we need a lot of examples. (We estimate somewhere between 20.000 and 50.000 example combinations.)</p>
<p>So, where will we get this many triple combinations of images, similar images, and different images, without spending years collecting them manually? This is where text processing comes in. Before we even start to work with the images, we will collect the image metadata records from our museum partners - the descriptions, keywords, notes that the curators have entered into their collection databases, the people and places connected to the artworks. In our first project phase, we will apply artificial intelligence language models in order to group and cluster metadata records that include similar descriptions, and then use this information to choose our training images automatically.</p>
<p>Has this been done before? Individual steps have, and recent language models have been shown to produce exciting results for semantic clustering before. Their use as a basis for training image similarity models, however, is still fairly new. As is the training of larger custom AI models in general (exactly because obtaining sufficient training data is so challenging)! Most applications therefore rely on existing, pre-trained open source models. Trained on large image collections harvested from the Web, these work well in many general contexts (and certainly know the difference between cats and dogs). But they are much less useful when it comes to dealing with art. Which is why we think LiviaAI will be such a useful addition. </p>
<h2>The Who</h2>
<p>The LiviaAI team comes from all sorts of backgrounds - we’re a diverse bunch!

<h2>Where We Are Now</h2>
<p>The project is beginning to gather steam! We’ve collected the  metadata from our museum partners and are now starting to experiment with different  clustering approaches in April. We’re also organising a workshop in early May to meet with the museum partners, share our initial results, and get some ideas from them about how their data is used by researchers and visitors, so that we can plan the next phase of data explorations. We’re planning to share regular updates on our progress at every stage, so keep an eye on things here!</p></div></div></section>
