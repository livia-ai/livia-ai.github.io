<p><em>We are about half-way through our project and, unfortunately, this means that our intern Bernhard has
completed his internship, and is leaving LiviaAI. Bernhard’s skills, creativity and commitment have
been crucial to our effort. His uncomplicated, down-to-earth style, and his ability to explain complex
things with ease and clarity have made working with him a pleasure. (Trust me, I have learned way more
from him than vice versa!) All of the cool stuff showcased on our blog -
<a href="https://livia-ai.github.io/blog/2022-04-machines-reading-metadata/" rel="nofollow">collection metadata sentence embeddings</a> or
the <a href="https://livia-ai.github.io/blog/2022-06-exploring-similarity/" rel="nofollow">automated triplet selection</a> - are his
work! Naturally, we are sad to let him go. But the good news is: there’s a ton of stuff that Bernhard has
created, which we haven’t shared with you so far. The best is yet to come! But first, before letting
Bernhard off the hook &amp; back to university, we have asked him to write about his internship
experience, and tell us about what LiviaAI was like for him!</em></p>
<h2>A Personal Conclusion on the Implementation of LiviaAI</h2>
<h4>By Bernhard Franzl</h4>
<p>My name is Bernhard Franzl and I am currently finishing my Bachelor’s degree in
<a href="https://www.jku.at/en/degree-programs/types-of-degree-programs/bachelors-and-diploma-degree-programs/ba-artificial-intelligence/" rel="nofollow">Artificial Intelligence at the Johannes Kepler University in Linz</a>.
I am currently writing my thesis, and I am about to start my Master’s in
the upcoming winter semester. In the six semesters I have studied so far, I
got to know a lot of different aspects of artificial intelligence. However,
many topics are only covered briefly, and with little reference to practical
application. Exercise courses, which focus on practice and implementation,
are only held for selected important aspects of Machine Learning. I assume
the reason is that the university simply does not have the resources to go
into more detail. Moreover, I think the tasks - and especially datasets - in
the exercises are a bit too simplified and with little practical relevance.
Therefore, I felt the need to work on something more realistic, and I began
searching for an internship.</p>
<h2>LiviaAI</h2>
<p>I started working on the LiviaAI project in April 2022, and was instantly
excited about it. My initial challenge was to find out how I could apply
what I had learned at university to the tasks of LiviaAI. However, I quickly
realised that my practical university knowledge would fit perfectly, and
that LiviaAI was in fact a great opportunity to test my knowledge - and
get some feedback on the way! </p>
<p>I found it refreshing to work with real-world cultural data. It was fascinating
to get a look inside the museum collections. I think that the connection
between culture and data science is what made this internship so interesting
to me. In particular, I also enjoyed the opportunity to work with visual
arts data, because I am particularly interested in computer vision and
applications that involve image data.</p>
<p>I think that, most of all, my internship has improved my programming skills.
Working constantly on the project’s many small programming tasks made it a
routine. Furthermore, it was interesting to work with PyPI (the Python
package management repository) to publish the main LiviaAI code as a Python
package. This was a great opportunity to learn the basics about Python
package maintenance. </p>
<p>Even though I feel I was well prepared for the project, I still had to do a
lot of research. This was admittedly sometimes boring. But I learned about a
lot of new algorithms, models and concepts. For me the most fascinating ones
were Sentence Transformers, because they are just extremely useful. At the
university, we were only briefly introduced to the underlying mechanism.
Doing more research and applying them in practice turned out to be very
interesting, and I gained a lot of new insights.</p>
<p>All in all, I am very satisfied with my internship at the Austrian Institute
of Technology. It fulfilled all my expectations, and gave me the opportunity
to test my knowledge on a challenging real-world problem. I am happy that
I had the chance to be a part of LiviaAI. </p>
